# Restaurant Page

[Live preview](https://firecattos.github.io/Restaurant-Page/)

This project, developed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) course, focused more on writing modular code and learning how Webpack handles dependencies and bundling, rather than building a complex site.

In addiction to understanding how Webpack manages dependencies and bundles code for the browser, I also had the opportunity to practice using `documentFragment` to build DOM nodes more efficiently instead of appending them directly to the DOM.

For the site itself, I chose to keep a minimalist yet clean design, avoiding complex layouts.

Another useful technique I discovered was how to append `<br>` element in small text blocks that don't require complex styling.

This project took longer than expected due to a road accident, which kept me away for a couple of months.
